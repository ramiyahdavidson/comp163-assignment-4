•	What your game is about (your creative theme)
My game is a college life simulation where the player balances academics, study hours, social points, and stress levels. Each decision—such as course load, study subject, or extracurricular opportunities—affects the student’s path. The theme reflects the trade-offs students face in real life between grades, social life, and well-being. perfect GPA yet, want to try again?")


•	Which branching concepts are demonstrated where
Course load choice (A/B/C): Demonstrates if/elif/else branching with GPA requirements and consequences for study hours and stress.
Study subject choice: Uses branching with multiple conditions (nested if/elif) to show how GPA affects outcomes differently for Programming/Math vs. English/History.
Opportunity events (Research/Sports): Demonstrates branching with conditions to simulate random opportunities that impact GPA or social points.
Multiple endings: The final section branches into different endings (Ending 1–5) based on GPA, stress, social points, and chosen course load.


•	How to run the game
Save the code into a Python file (e.g., student_game.py).
Run the game in a IDE:
Follow the text prompts and enter your choices.


•	What the different endings represent
Ending 1: Perfect balance — you managed GPA and stress well.
Ending 2: Academically successful but too stressed — a warning about burnout.
Ending 3: Balanced life — strong GPA and good social standing.
Ending 4: Decent GPA but poor social balance — suggests you should relax more.
Ending 5: Struggling student — GPA is too low, need to focus harder.


•	Any AI assistance used during development
Yes, I used AI (ChatGPT) to:
Help debug branching logic and fix errors with conditions.
Suggest clearer structures for if/elif/else statements.
Give feedback on balancing stats (GPA, stress, social points).
Provide explanations and summaries of what the endings mean.
